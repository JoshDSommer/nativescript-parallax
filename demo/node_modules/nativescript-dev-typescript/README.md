TypeScript support for NativeScript projects
=======================================

How to use
----------
```
$ tns install typescript
```

The above command installs this module and installs the necessary hooks. TypeScript compilation happens when the project is prepared for build. A file named `tsconfig.json` that specifies compilation options will be created in the project folder and should be committed to source control.
